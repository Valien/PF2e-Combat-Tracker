```

5. Click "Publish release"

## 3. Add Screenshot/GIF to README

Follow the TODO comment in README.md (lines 12-35) to add a visual showcase.

### Quick Guide:

**Option A - Split Screenshot:**
1. Open two browser windows side by side
2. Left: DM view with some combatants, conditions, and HP management visible
3. Right: Player view (`?view=player`)
4. Take screenshot showing both
5. Save as `docs/screenshot.png`
6. In README, replace the TODO comment with:
   ```markdown
   ![DM and Player Views](docs/screenshot.png)
   ```

**Option B - Animated Demo (Recommended):**
1. Install screen recording tool:
   - macOS: [Kap](https://getkap.co/) (free)
   - Windows: [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (free)
   - Cross-platform: [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (free)

2. Record a 10-15 second demo showing:
   - Adding a combatant
   - Dealing damage
   - Adding a condition
   - Advancing turn
   - Switching to player view

3. Export as GIF (max 10MB for GitHub)
4. Save as `docs/demo.gif`
5. In README, replace the TODO comment with:
   ```markdown
   ![Initiative Tracker Demo](docs/demo.gif)
   ```

## 4. Set Up GitHub Pages

**Important**: Your project uses GitHub Actions for deployment, not branch deployment.

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. That's it!

**How it works**:
- When you push to `prod` branch, GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys
- See `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` for detailed explanation
- Your workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

The site will be available at: https://valforte.github.io/Initiative-Tracker/

## 5. Enable GitHub Discussions (Optional)

Great for community questions and feature discussions:

1. Go to Settings → General
2. Scroll to "Features"
3. Check ✅ "Discussions"
4. Click "Set up discussions"
5. Use the default categories or customize

## 6. Social Media Announcement (Optional)

Once everything is polished, share it with the community:

### Reddit:
- r/Pathfinder2e
- r/Pathfinder_RPG
- r/rpg
- r/DMAcademy (if it works for general TTRPGs)
